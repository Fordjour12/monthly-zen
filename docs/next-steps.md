Questions Before Proceeding

1. Do you want to port the quota system (generation limits) from testing-server, or skip it?
2. Do you want the productivity insights feature (historical data used for personalization)?
3. Do you want to include quota and insights database tables?
4. What OpenRouter model should be configured as default?
5. Should we keep the hybrid approach (simplified as in testing-server) or implement a different flow?

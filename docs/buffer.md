# The "Life-Load" Adjuster

The AI should monitor the user's actual progress in real-time and re-plan the remaining month every Sunday night.

    The Feature: If the user gets sick in Week 1 and misses their goals, the AI doesn't just let the tasks pile up. It performs a "Monthly Reset," automatically deprioritizing less urgent goals to ensure the "Must-Haves" still get done by the 30th without the user feeling overwhelmed.

## Smart "Buffer" Injection

Humans are notoriously bad at estimating how long things take (the Planning Fallacy).

    The Feature: The AI intentionally leaves "White Space" in the monthly plan. If it calculates that a project will take 10 hours, it might block out 13 hours. It acts as a safety net so that one flat tire or one long meeting doesn't ruin the entire month's plan.

## Auto-Chunking (Goal → Milestones)

Users often put "Big Goals" on a monthly view (e.g., "Launch Side Project") but don't know where to start.

    How it works: The user types a goal. The AI breaks it into 4 weekly milestones and distributes them across the month based on the user's historical "productivity peaks" (e.g., placing the hardest tasks in the weeks the user is usually most active).

## Adaptive "Dynamic Rollover"

Typical planners just move unfinished tasks to the next day. An AI planner should be smarter.

    How it works: If a task has been rolled over 5 times, the AI intervenes: "You’ve ignored 'Update Resume' for two weeks. Is this still a priority, or is it too overwhelming? I can break it into 15-minute micro-tasks for you."

## Smart Conflict Resolution (Buffer AI)

Life happens. When a user adds a sudden event (like a doctor's appointment), the AI reshuffles the month.

    How it works: It identifies "Low Impact" tasks that can be pushed to next month or swapped with "High Priority" tasks to ensure the month's primary objective stays on track.

## Predictive Habit Coaching

The AI looks for patterns in the monthly data that a human might miss.

    How it works: "I noticed that every third week of the month, your sleep and exercise habits drop by 40%. Would you like to schedule 'Maintenance Mode' for next week to avoid burnout?"
